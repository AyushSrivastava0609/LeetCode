Intuition:-

The romanToInt function aims to convert a Roman numeral represented as a string into an integer.

Approach:-

Roman Numeral Values:
Create a HashMap named romanValues to store the integer values corresponding to each Roman numeral character. 
This map will allow easy lookup of values during the conversion process.

Conversion Process:
Initialize a variable result to store the final integer representation of the Roman numeral.

Iterating Through the Roman Numeral String:
Use a for loop to iterate through each character of the input string s.

Processing Each Character:
Retrieve the integer value of the current Roman numeral character using the romanValues map.

Handling Subtractive Notation:
Check if the current numeral is smaller than the next numeral in the string. If so, this indicates subtractive notation (e.g., IV = 4, IX = 9). 
In such cases, subtract the current value from the result.

Adding to Result:
If subtractive notation is not present or the current numeral is greater than or equal to the next numeral, add the current value to the result.

Returning Result:
Once all characters have been processed, return the final result, which represents the integer equivalent of the input Roman numeral string.

Note: This approach efficiently converts the Roman numeral string to its integer representation by iterating through each character and considering subtractive notation when necessary. 
It ensures that the conversion process follows the rules of Roman numeral representation.
