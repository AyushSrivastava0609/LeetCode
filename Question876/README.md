Intuition:-

We want to find the middle node of a given linked list.
If the list has an odd number of nodes, the middle node is easy to identify.
If the list has an even number of nodes, there are two middle nodes. We will return the second middle node.

Approach:-

Initialize two pointers, fast and slow, pointing to the head of the list.
Traverse the list with the fast pointer moving two steps at a time and the slow pointer moving one step at a time.
When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., fast becomes null or fast.next becomes null), the slow pointer will be at the middle node.
Return the node pointed to by the slow pointer as the middle node of the linked list.
This approach ensures that we find the middle node of the linked list efficiently in a single pass through the list.
