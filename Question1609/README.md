Intuition:

The problem asks us to determine if a given binary tree is an even-odd tree. An even-odd tree is a binary tree where at each level, the nodes' values satisfy specific conditions:

Nodes at even levels have strictly increasing values (starting from an odd integer) and are all odd integers.
Nodes at odd levels have strictly decreasing values (starting from an even integer) and are all even integers.
To solve this problem, we need to traverse the tree level by level and check if the nodes at each level meet the defined conditions.

Approach:

We will use level order traversal (BFS) to traverse the binary tree level by level.
At each level, we'll maintain a flag to determine if the level is even or odd. We'll initialize this flag as true for the root level.
For each level, we'll check if the values of the nodes satisfy the given conditions:
If the level is even, we ensure that all node values are odd integers and strictly increasing.
If the level is odd, we ensure that all node values are even integers and strictly decreasing.
To accomplish this, we'll use a queue to perform the level order traversal.
While traversing each level, we'll keep track of the previous node's value. For even levels, this value should be smaller than the current node's value, and for odd levels, it should be larger.
If any node violates the defined conditions, we'll return false immediately.
After traversing the entire tree, if no violation is found, we'll return true, indicating that the tree is an even-odd tree.
