Intuition:-

The letterCombinations function generates all possible combinations of letters that can be formed by pressing the digits on a phone keypad.
For example, if the input is "23", the output should contain combinations like "ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", and "cf".

Approach:-

Initialization:
Initialize an empty list ans to store the generated combinations.
Check if the input digits is empty. If it is, return an empty list.

Mapping Digits to Letters:
Create a HashMap hm to map each digit to the corresponding letters on a phone keypad.

Backtracking:
Implement a backtracking function backtrack to generate combinations recursively.

The function takes parameters:
digits: the input string of digits.
i: the current index being processed.
hm: the HashMap mapping digits to letters.
sb: a StringBuilder to build the current combination.
ans: the list to store the generated combinations.

If i equals the length of digits, it means we have formed a complete combination. Add the combination to the ans list and return.
Get the string of letters corresponding to the current digit at index i.

Iterate through each letter in the string:
Append the letter to the StringBuilder sb.
Recursively call the backtrack function with the next index i+1.
After the recursive call, backtrack by removing the last character from sb.

Return Result:
After backtracking is complete, return the list ans containing all generated combinations.

Note: This approach utilizes backtracking to generate all possible combinations efficiently. 
By mapping each digit to its corresponding letters, it explores all possible combinations recursively, ensuring that each combination is formed according to the rules of a phone keypad.
