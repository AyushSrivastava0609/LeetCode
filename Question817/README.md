Intuition :-

The intuition behind the provided Java solution is to count the number of connected components in a linked list where the values of the connected components are present in a given array nums.

Approach:-

HashSet Creation: First, create a HashSet to store the elements of the given array nums. This allows for constant-time lookup of elements.

Traverse the Linked List: Traverse through the linked list while there are still nodes remaining.

Count Connected Components: For each node in the linked list, check if its value is present in the HashSet. If it is, it indicates the start of a connected component.

Track Previous Element: Keep track of whether the previous element encountered in the linked list was present in the HashSet.
If the current element is in the HashSet and the previous element wasn't, it means the current element starts a new connected component, so increment the groupsCount.

Update Previous Element: Update the status of whether the current element is present in the HashSet for the next iteration.

Move to Next Node: Move to the next node in the linked list and repeat the process.

Return Count: Finally, return the count of connected components found in the linked list.

This approach effectively leverages HashSet for quick lookup of elements from the array nums while traversing the linked list to determine connected components based on the presence of elements in the HashSet.
