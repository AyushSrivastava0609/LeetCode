Intuition:-

To remove the nth node from the end of a linked list, one approach is to use two pointers. 
The first pointer advances n+1 steps ahead of the second pointer. Then, while the first pointer is not null, both pointers advance one step at a time.
This way, when the first pointer reaches the end of the list, the second pointer will be pointing to the node before the nth node from the end.

Approach:-

1.We create a dummy node ref and set its next pointer to the head of the original list. This dummy node helps handle edge cases where the node to be removed is the head of the list.
2.We initialize two pointers, first and last, both pointing to the dummy node.
3.We advance the first pointer by n+1 steps.
4.We iterate through the list while first is not null:
5.We advance both first and last pointers one step at a time.
6.When the loop exits, last will be pointing to the node before the nth node from the end.
7.We update the next pointer of the node pointed to by last to skip the nth node from the end.
8.We return ref.next, which is the head of the modified list.
Note: The dummy node ref ensures that if the node to be removed is the head of the list, we can handle it efficiently by simply returning ref.next as the new head of the list.

This approach efficiently removes the nth node from the end of the linked list by using two pointers and traversing the list only once. 
It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
