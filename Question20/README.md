Intuition:-

The goal of the problem is to determine whether the input string s contains valid parentheses, brackets, and curly braces.
A valid string should have matching opening and closing pairs of parentheses, brackets, and curly braces.

Approach:-
We'll use a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses, brackets, and curly braces encountered while iterating through the characters of the input string s.

For each character c in the string s:
If c is an opening parenthesis, bracket, or curly brace, we push the corresponding closing character onto the stack.

If c is a closing parenthesis, bracket, or curly brace:
We check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no matching opening character for c, so we return false.
Otherwise, we pop the top character from the stack and compare it with c. If they don't match, it means the parentheses, brackets, or curly braces are not in the correct order, so we return false.
After iterating through all characters in the string, if there are any remaining characters in the stack, it means there are unmatched opening parentheses, brackets, or curly braces, so we return false.
If the stack is empty after processing all characters, it means all opening characters have been matched with their corresponding closing characters, and the string is valid. We return true.
This approach ensures that each opening character is matched with its correct closing character in the string, and any mismatch or imbalance in the parentheses, brackets, or curly braces will result in an invalid string.
