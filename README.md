Intuition:-

The problem requires finding the Hamming distance between two integers, which is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Approach:-

Initialize a variable count to keep track of the number of differing bits.
Iterate over the bits of the integers x and y until both become 0.
At each iteration, compare the least significant bits of x and y using bitwise AND (&) operation with 1. If they are different, increment the count.
Right shift both x and y by 1 to move to the next bits.
After the loop, return the count as the result of the Hamming distance.
Additionally, there is a commented-out line return Integer.bitCount(x ^ y);, which also calculates the Hamming distance using a more concise approach:

XOR (^) operation between x and y results in a number with set bits at positions where the corresponding bits are different.
Integer.bitCount counts the number of set bits in the result of the XOR operation, which is equivalent to the Hamming distance.
However, only one of the two return statements should be used in the final solution, as they serve the same purpose.
