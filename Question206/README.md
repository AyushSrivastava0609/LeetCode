Intuition:
The intuition behind this algorithm is to reverse the pointers of each node in the linked list. By doing so, the direction of the list is reversed, effectively reversing the order of the elements.

Approach:

Base Case Handling:

If the input head is null or the list has only one node (head.next is null), there is no need to reverse anything. In such cases, the head itself is returned.
Initialization:

Initialize two pointers: prev and curr.
Initially, prev is set to null and curr is set to the head of the list.
Iterative Reversal:

Iterate through the list using a while loop until curr becomes null.
Inside the loop:
Store the next node of curr in a temporary variable next.
Reverse the pointer of curr to point to its previous node, which is prev.
Move prev to curr and curr to next for the next iteration.
Returning the New Head:

Once the loop ends, prev will be pointing to the last node of the original list, which is now the new head of the reversed list.
Return prev as the head of the reversed list.
Overall:
The algorithm iterates through the original linked list, reversing the pointers of each node to change the direction of the list. After the iteration, the last node of the original list becomes the new head of the reversed list, which is then returned. This approach achieves the reversal of the linked list efficiently in a single pass.
