Intuition:-

The goal of the maxArea function is to determine the maximum area that can be formed between two vertical lines in a 2D plane. 
These vertical lines are represented by the heights given in the input array.

Approach:-

Initialization:
Initialize two pointers, left and right, at the beginning and end of the array respectively. Also, initialize a variable maxArea to store the maximum area found so far.

Loop:
Use a while loop to iterate while left is less than right. This ensures that all possible pairs of lines are considered for area calculation.

Calculate Area:
Within each iteration:
Calculate the area formed by the two vertical lines represented by the heights at indices left and right.
The area is calculated as the minimum height between the two lines multiplied by the distance between them (right - left).

Update Maximum Area:
Update maxArea to store the maximum of the current area and the previously calculated maximum area.

Move Pointers:
Move the pointers left and right based on the following conditions:
If the height at left is less than the height at right, increment left.
Otherwise, decrement right.

Return Maximum Area:
Once the loop terminates, return the maximum area calculated.

Note: This approach efficiently calculates the maximum area by iteratively adjusting the pointers to consider different pairs of lines and updating the maximum area accordingly. 
The use of two pointers helps in avoiding redundant calculations and ensures a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array height.
