Intuition:-

The code aims to determine whether a given linked list is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backward.

Approach:-

Using a Stack:
Traverse the linked list and push each node's value onto a stack.
Then, traverse the linked list again and pop values from the stack. Compare the popped value with the current node's value.
If at any point the values don't match, it means the linked list is not a palindrome.
If the traversal completes without any mismatch, it indicates that the linked list is a palindrome.

Traversal:
Use two pointers, one slow and one fast, to find the middle of the linked list.
Reverse the second half of the linked list.
Compare each node of the first half with the reversed second half.
If all nodes match, the linked list is a palindrome.
In this code, the approach uses a stack. It traverses the linked list twice:

In the first traversal, it pushes each node's value onto the stack.
In the second traversal, it compares each node's value with the popped value from the stack.
If all values match, it returns true, indicating that the linked list is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns false.
