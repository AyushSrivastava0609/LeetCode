Intuition:-

The objective of the reverse method is to reverse the digits of an integer x. For instance, if x is 123, the method should return 321. If x is -123, the method should return -321.

Approach:-

Initialize a variable to store the reversed number:
We initialize a long variable revnum to store the reversed number. We use a long type to accommodate the possibility of integer overflow during the reversal process.

Reverse the digits:
We enter a while loop to reverse the digits of the input x.

In each iteration of the loop:
We obtain the last digit of x by using the modulo operator (x % 10), which gives us the remainder when x is divided by 10.
This digit is then appended to the reversed number (revnum) by multiplying revnum by 10 and adding the last digit.
We update x by removing the last digit (divide x by 10).
This process continues until x becomes 0, indicating that all digits have been processed.

Check for overflow:
Since the problem requires returning 0 if the reversed integer overflows, we need to check if revnum exceeds the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer (Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE).
If revnum is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE or less than Integer.MIN_VALUE, we return 0.

Return the reversed number:
Finally, we return the reversed number, casting it to an int type.

Note: Using long for revnum ensures that we can handle larger integers without encountering overflow during the reversal process.
The logic of reversing the digits and checking for overflow ensures that the method behaves correctly for both positive and negative input integers.
